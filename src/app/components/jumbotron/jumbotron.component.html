            Welcome to Yu-Gi-Oh! Draft Cube Simulator, a place where you and friends can draft and build a deck from a
            curated prebuilt cube of cards or sealed packs.
            Drafted decks can be exported as a .ydk file and imported into
            <a routerLink="/how-to" fragment="Dueling Book">DuelingBook</a>,
            <a routerLink="/how-to" fragment="EdoPro">EdoPro</a>,
            <a routerLink="/how-to" fragment="Dueling Nexus">Dueling Nexus</a>,
            <a routerLink="/how-to" fragment="YGO Omega">YGO Omega</a>, etc.
            No sign up is required to start drafting, but sign in or sign up to create your cubes and star your favorite
            cubes for next time.
            <b><i>This is currently a work in progress</i></b>, so most of the major functionality is not currently
            working.
            Feel free to play around in the meantime, and come back soon when we're ready for some drafting fun.
